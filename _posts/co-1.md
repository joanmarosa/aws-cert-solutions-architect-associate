Design Principles
-Adopt a consumption model: Pay only for the computing resources
you consume, and increase or decrease usage depending on business
requirements—not with elaborate forecasting
-Adopt a consumption model: Pay only for the computing resources

-Stop spending money on data center operations
-Analyze and attribute expenditure: The cloud makes it easier to
accurately identify the usage and cost of systems, which then allows
transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams and individual
business owners.
-Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership: In the cloud,
managed services remove the operational burden of maintaining servers
for tasks like sending email or managing databases. Since managed
services operate at cloud scale, they can offer a lower cost per transaction
or service.

Focus is on 4 areas

• Cost-effective resources
• Matching supply with demand
• Expenditure awareness
• Optimizing over time


Devise a cost optimization strategy up front to see the
economic benefits of the cloud.


Cost-Effective Resources

There are a number of different approaches to ensure cost effectiveness:
• Appropriate provisioning
• Right sizing
• Purchasing options: On Demand Instances, Spot Instances, and Reserved Instances
• Geographic selection
• Managed services
• Optimize data transfer
